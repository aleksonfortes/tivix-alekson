I created the main structure about cypress for Tivit interview page, we still have many opportunities to improve this small project.

We could do much more tests, but I think here is enough to show my knowledge about cypress.

Also, would be nice to work closer to developers to plan the tests and do some scenarios in the componenet/integration level instead of e2e tests.

I created many TODOs here regarding selectors. What I would suggest is using data-cy element to map better the page elements as cypress docs recommends.



Remember: you have to run npm install to install cypress.

To run the tests on cypress:


npx cypress run -> to run via console

npx cypress open -> to run via cypress dashboard

Requirements: node.js installed.
